Dear Liao Xuefeng,
I'm a year 1 student just learning git by myself. Recently, I have been designing a project with my teammate however it's really hard for me to use git
at the first time. For this we waste a lots of time. Thanks for much for your guidance. It's really clear and precise.  I feel like I love git more and really enjoy 
playing with it.

Thanks you again and wish you all the best.

Sincerely,
Xiaoyuan
