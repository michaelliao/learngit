This is the first file that be upload to the github from my own computer.
Several months ago,my tutor advised me to learn how to use git to improve my
learning in the laboratory.I didn't pay my attention to it at that
time,because I regarded it as unuseful before I learn about Git.But now,I
finally spend time on learning the Git,and I am completely be touched by the
ability of Git.Now,I upload a litle txt on the github,I am so exciting to be
a part of github!
