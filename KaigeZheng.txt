Thanks for your wiki document(https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/896043488029600).
I'm a sophomore majoring in CS from QHU.
That's really helpful for my learning in git.
The course is really accessible and I have organized my notes when learning it by onenote.
Of course I will origanized it again by Markdown and open source it on github.

With my utmost respect and thanks.
