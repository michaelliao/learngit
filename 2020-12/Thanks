Thank you Michaelliao,
I am a master student learning climate change. Git really helps me a lot. 
I had tried to learn git last year but the courses are tricky...
You course is easy to understand and interesting. I will never forget the 
picture you used to illustrate the definition of 变基. hhh
Hope you have a lovely day!
